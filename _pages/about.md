title: "About me"
---

I’m a PhD candidate in Computational Science and Engineering at Georgia Tech.

My research interests are in large-scale graph mining and processing. I’m
advised by Professor [Umit V. Catalyurek](http://cc.gatech.edu/~umit).

The main thesis of my PhD. work is that <em>block-based graph algorithms offer a sweet spot
between efficient parallelism and architecture agnostic algorithm design for a wide class
of graph problems</em>.

During my PhD. I try to prove this thesis by focusing the work in the
three pillars; data/computation partitioning, block-based algorithm design, and performance
portability. Recently I work on proposing a novel algorithmic framework.
