I’m a PhD candidate in Computational Science and Engineering at Georgia Tech.
My research interests are in large-scale graph mining and processing. I’m
advised by Professor [Umit V. Catalyurek](http://cc.gatech.edu/~umit).

Therefore, partitioning is the first step and refers to both data and computation partitioning. Towards my PhD. I studied several efficient partitioning techniques to speed up graph algorithms and most irregular problems. |
