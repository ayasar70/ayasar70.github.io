I’m a DevTech engineer at Nvidia.

Prior to that, I received my PhD. from Georgia Tech under supervision of Professor Umit V. Catalyurek. My research interests are in large-scale graph mining and processing.

Partitioning is the first step and refers to both data and computation partitioning. Towards my PhD. I studied several efficient partitioning techniques to speed up irregular problems.

| ![GitHub Logo](/assets/images/gvm.png){:width="1024px"} | <strong>Scalable Graph Mining:</strong> I worked on several graph mining problems. First, I proposed a novel, fast graph merging algorithm, and a data-parallel, architecture (resource)-aware scalable graph merging framework. Second, I studied triangle counting problem and proposes a coarse-grained and medium-grained triangle counting algorithms. [Read More](./publications)|
| ![GitHub Logo](/assets/images/tc-hyb.png){:width="1024px"} | <strong>Performance Portability:</strong> Today's heterogeneous computing environments increased the importance of designing flexible algorithms for performance-critical kernels that can run well on various platforms. I studied on porting graph merging algorithm to an emerging architecture and I also proposed a triangle counting formulation suitable for shared and distributed-memory systems as well as for heterogeneous architectures.[Read More](./publications)|
