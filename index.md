I’m Abdurrahman (Apo), a PhD candidate in Computational Science and Engineering at Georgia Tech.
My research interests are in large-scale graph mining and processing. I’m
advised by Professor [Umit V. Catalyurek](http://cc.gatech.edu/~umit).

The main thesis of my PhD. work is that block-based graph algorithms offer a sweet spot
between efficient parallelism and architecture agnostic algorithm design for a wide class
of graph problems. During my PhD. I try to prove this thesis by focusing the work in the
three pillars; data/computation partitioning, block-based algorithm design, and performance
portability. Each of these components brings new challenges and they are closely interrelated.
Therefore effective solutions require attention to all three areas. Throughout the development
of my PhD., I have used my knowledge in each of those areas to improve my understanding of
issues arising in the other areas.

Recently I work on proposing a novel algorithmic framework, Parallel Graph Algorithms by Block
(PGAbB) which focuses on block-based algorithm design to make it possible to implement
higly efficient, architecture agnostic graph algorithms that perform close to hand-optimized
HPC implementations.
