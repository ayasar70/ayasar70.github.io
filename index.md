| ![GitHub Logo](/assets/images/sarma.png) | <strong> Partitioning </strong> In a distributed platform, the balanced distribution of the computation and the data to the processors is crucial for achieving good efficiency. Therefore, partitioning is the first step and refers to both data and computation partitioning. However, on a shared memory ma- chine one can run parallel algorithms without partitioning the data but the computation. |
