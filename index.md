I’m a PhD candidate in Computational Science and Engineering at Georgia Tech.
My research interests are in large-scale graph mining and processing. I’m
advised by Professor [Umit V. Catalyurek](http://cc.gatech.edu/~umit).

Partitioning is the first step and refers to both data and computation partitioning. Towards my PhD. I studied several efficient partitioning techniques to speed up irregular problems. |

First, I proposed a novel, fast graph merging algorithm, and a data-parallel, architecture (resource)-aware scalable graph merging framework. Second, I studied triangle counting problem and proposes a coarse-grained and medium-grained triangle counting algorithms. |
