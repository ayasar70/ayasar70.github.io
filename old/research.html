Although several disk based graph management systems have been proposed still they are limited and have several problems. In this project we study on efficient graph computations on a single PC. Our goal is to develop general purpose graph processing framework and software system in storage, access and computation tiers. Our approach leverages locality and sparseness of real graphs and proposes a novel parallel execution model for extended(HDDs and SSDs) and semi extended(SSD arrays) memory models.

Communication is one of the most important problems for distributed graph management systems. In this project we study on efficient graph computations on distributed environments. Our goal is to develop general purpose dynamically distributed graph processing framework and software system in storage, access and computation tiers. Our approach runs on top of our single PC graph management system therefore it isnâ€™t limited by distributed memory size and it also leverages from the locality aware processing.

We are witnessing an enormous growth in social networks as well as 
in the volume of data generated by them. An important portion of 
this data is in the form of graphs. In recent years, several graph 
processing and management systems emerged to handle large-scale 
graphs. The primary goal of these systems is to run graph algorithms 
in an efficient and scalable manner. Unlike relational data, graphs 
are semi-structured in nature. Thus, storing and accessing graph data 
using secondary storage requires new solutions that can provide 
locality of access for graph processing workloads. In this work, we 
propose a novel scalable disk layout technique for graphs, which aims 
at reducing the I/O cost of disk-based graph processing algorithms. 
To achieve this goal, we designed a scalable Map/Reduce-style method 
called ICBP, which can divide the graph into a series of disk blocks 
that contain sub-graphs with high locality. Furthermore, ICBP can order 
the resulting blocks on the disk to further reduce non-local accesses. 
We experimentally evaluated ICBP to showcase its scalability, layout 
quality, as well as the effectiveness of automatic parameter tuning 
for ICBP. We also deployed the graph layouts generated by ICBP to the 
Neo4j graph database management system. Our experimental results 
show that the layout generated by ICBP reduces the query running times 
over Neo4j more than 2x compared to the default layout.
